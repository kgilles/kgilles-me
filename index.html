                Since 2017 I've pivoted to become a developer instead of a tester by working as a developer on multiple React projects within Klarna.

              <p>
                Thanks to my background I have easily been able to flow into a developer role. It has also given me great tools on how to assess and understand user expectations and interactions. I enjoy analyzing application statistics and data to find ways to improve UI, UX, performance, etc. A/B testing is your friend!

                During my years as a QA I have done a little bit of everything that the title stands for. From the analytical part of understanding data and business requirements to write up test plans, cases and processes, to the testing side of it where I have performed both manual and automated testing for web on a multitude of desktop and mobile devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developing automation frameworks and tests has been on my plate during my time as well, touching multiple programming languages.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have also been responsible for setting up and maintaining web tools and testing environments used by my team and our stakeholders to demo and test our products.

                I started working in the e-commerce business in 2011 as a technical support agent for merchants and their e-commerce platforms. Helping them troubleshoot plugin integrations and very often having to dive into the platform code. I also worked a lot with the post-purchase order and customer handling.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later on I started as a QA for Klarna's full fledged checkout product focusing on conversion, data collection and payments. Nowadays I'm working strictly with pre-purchase address and data collection.

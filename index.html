                Since 2017 I have been contributing as a developer on multiple JavaScript projects within Klarna<span class="wide-only"> while working mainly on our address collection module</span>.

                Work has involved everything from component structures, state management, APIs, performance improvements, CORS, unit testing and more.

                My QA background gives me the unique perspective of the developer <i>and</i> the user. This has improved my ability to better understand and develop with the user in mind.

                My dad was a goalie which inspired me to be one too. What makes me well-suited to be a goalie is that I enjoy the pressure and responsibility of being the last line of defense. Plus, it did not hurt that I was one of the few people crazy enough to get in front of the pucks.

                During my years as a QA I have done a little bit of everything<span class="wide-only"> that the title stands for</span>. From the analytical part of understanding data and business requirements to writing up test plans, cases and processes, to the testing side of it where I have performed both manual and automated testing for web<span class="wide-only"> on the most common desktop and mobile devices</span>.

                I have always been interested in playing with technology. Both software and hardware. I built my first desktop computer in high school and got a minor heart attack when it did not turn on. Of course I had missed the oh so elusive on/off-switch on the power supply.

                Since then I have aquired an interest in home automation. I set up my own hub on a Raspberry Pi and now I am finally able talk to my lights.<span class="wide-only"> It was a great feeling the first time they listened to me.</span>

                I started working in the e-commerce business in 2011 as a technical support agent for merchants and their e-commerce platforms. Helping them troubleshoot plugin integrations and frequently having to dive into the platform code. I also worked a lot with the post-purchase order and customer handling.

                Later on I started as a QA for Klarna's full fledged checkout product focusing on conversion, data collection and payments. Nowadays I am working with pre-purchase address and data collection.

                On a similar vein I enjoy experimenting with growing plants on my small balcony. I have scavenged the seed section in nearby stores and found a bunch to play with.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is rewarding to harvest the plants to get fresh ingredients for cooking recipes. A small touch that can make a big difference.

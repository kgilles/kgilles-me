                Since 2017 I've pivoted to become a developer instead of a tester by working as a developer on multiple React projects within Klarna.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to my background I have easily been able to flow into a developer role. It has also given me great tools on how to assess and understand user expectations and interactions. I enjoy analyzing application statistics and data to find ways to improve UI, UX, performance, etc. A/B testing is your friend!

                I started playing hockey(aka. falling around on the ice) when I was six years old. Opted for the goalie position as soon as it became available because my dad used to be a goalie. Aslo because no one else was crazy enough to get in front of the pucks.
              </p>
              <p>
                Played on different levels and tried to break out when I was 16, but that didn't work out. After that I left organized hockey until I came to the US.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Organized" might not be the right word now however as I'm playing in an amateur league. Mostly looking to have fun but still with a good pinch of competitiveness.

                During my years as a QA I have done a little bit of everything that the title stands for. From the analytical part of understanding data and business requirements to writing up test plans, cases and processes, to the testing side of it where I have performed both manual and automated testing for web on a multitude of desktop and mobile devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developing and maintaining automation frameworks and tests has been on my plate during my time as well, touching multiple programming languages.

                A friend of mine got me started with home automation a few years back. Since I live in an apartment there's not much I'm allowed to do unfortunately, but I'm enjoying trying out what I can.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've set up my own hub on a Raspberry Pi and now I can finally talk to my lights. It was a great feeling the first time they listened to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm excited for when I buy my own place and can start playing around for real with more than just lights and motion sensors.

                I started working in the e-commerce business in 2011 as a technical support agent for merchants and their e-commerce platforms. Helping them troubleshoot plugin integrations and very often having to dive into the platform code. I also worked a lot with the post-purchase order and customer handling.

                Later on I started as a QA for Klarna's full fledged checkout product focusing on conversion, data collection and payments. Nowadays I'm working with pre-purchase address and data collection.

                On a similar vein as the home automation, living in an apartment doesn't give me much room to play with plants. But I'm using my balcony as much as I can to try and grow some useful stuff such as garlic, basil and more.

                I'd like to think I've inherited a green thumb from my mom. But I suspect that my strawberry plants think otherwise...

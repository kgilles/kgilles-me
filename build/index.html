                Since 2017 I have been contributing as a developer on multiple JavaScript projects within Klarna while working mainly on our address collection module.
              </p>
              <p>
                Work has involved everything from component structures, state management, APIs, performance improvements, CORS, unit testing and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                My QA background gives me the unique perspective of the developer <i>and</i> the user. This has improved my ability to better understand and develop with the user in mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy analyzing application statistics and data to find ways to improve UI, UX, performance, etc. A/B-testing is your friend!

                I started playing hockey when I was six years old, a.k.a. falling around on the ice.

                My dad was a goalie which inspired me to be one too. What makes me well-suited to be a goalie is that I enjoy the pressure and responsibility of being the last line of defense. Plus, it did not hurt that I was one of the few people crazy enough to get in front of the pucks.

                Nowadays I am playing in a recreational league. Mostly looking to have fun but still with a good pinch of competitiveness.

                During my years as a QA I have done a little bit of everything that the title stands for. From the analytical part of understanding data and business requirements to writing up test plans, cases and processes, to the testing side of it where I have performed both manual and automated testing for web on the most common desktop and mobile devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Developing and maintaining automation frameworks and tests has been on my plate during my time as well, touching multiple programming languages.

                I have always been interested in playing with technology. Both software and hardware. In high school I built my first desktop computer and got a minor heart attack when it did not turn on. Of course I had missed the oh so elusive on/off-switch on the power supply.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since then I have aquired an interest in home automation. I set up my own hub on a Raspberry Pi and now I am finally able talk to my lights. It was a great feeling the first time they listened to me.

                I started working in the e-commerce business in 2011 as a technical support agent for merchants and their e-commerce platforms. Helping them troubleshoot plugin integrations and frequently having to dive into the platform code. I also worked a lot with the post-purchase order and customer handling.

              <p>
                Later on I started as a QA for Klarna's full fledged checkout product focusing on conversion, data collection and payments. Nowadays I am working with pre-purchase address and data collection.

                On a similar vein I enjoy experimenting with growing plants on my small balcony. I have scavenged the seed section in nearby stores and found a bunch to play with.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is rewarding to harvest the plants to get fresh ingredients for cooking recipes. A small touch that can make a big difference.

                I would like to think I have inherited a green thumb from my mom. But I suspect my strawberry plants think otherwise...
